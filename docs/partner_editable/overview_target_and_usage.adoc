This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-short-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for IT, cloud, and developer professionals who want to deploy a fully functional Kubernetes infrastructure to assist in the management of containerized applications located in AWS, data centers, and at network edges. With MKP, organizations can leverage critical enterprise-grade requirements such as global visibility, security, and management of Kubernetes clusters from a single management console.

=== MKP on AWS

Rafay lets users to provision Kubernetes clusters on both "public cloud" and "on-premises" environments. Rafay provides streamlined provisioning approaches that allow users to bring up a "managed" Kubernetes cluster:

*Automatically provisioned* clusters are primarily designed for public cloud environments where core infrastructure (compute, storage, networking) can be programmatically created and configured by Rafay. It's designed to be a completely automated experience for users. This approach is currently supported for Amazon AWS EC2 and Amazon EKS public cloud environments. For High Availability (HA) clusters, Rafay automatically provisions master nodes in different Availability Zones (AZ).

*Manually provisioned* clusters are agnostic to the type and provider of the underlying infrastructure and are mostly used for clusters that run bare metal and virtual machines (VMs). With this approach, customers are responsible for the underlying hardware and operating system of the nodes.

Existing clusters (for example, within a datacenter) can be imported to the MKP. When all clusters are provisioned or imported, the MKP provides a single console that provides visibility and management of applications and clusters across the entire infrastructure. The benefits of this include the following:

*Single pane-of-glass management across AWS Regions and on premises*: Use a single console to deploy, view, and manage clusters and workloads across all clusters.

*Accelerate migration to AWS:* With Rafay, Amazon EKS clusters can be running in minutes (including spot instances), and applications can be deployed in even less time.

*Apply enterprise-grade K8s security on AWS*: Rafayâ€™s zero-trust architecture for Kubernetes lets enterprises  cloak their Kubernetes API endpoints on AWS without affecting CI/CD and developer workflows.
