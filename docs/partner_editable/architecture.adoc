Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

//.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
//image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[width=100%,height=100%]

//As shown in <<architecture>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in private subnets. The bastion host is also configured with the Kubernetes `kubectl` command line interface (CLI) for managing the Kubernetes cluster.
* An Amazon EKS cluster, which creates the Kubernetes control plane.
* In the private subnets, a group of Kubernetes nodes that run the Rafay operator software with ties to the Rafay controller SAAS.

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
